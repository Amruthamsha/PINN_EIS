## üìò Overview
This project implements a **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)** to estimate the **State of Charge (SoC)** of batteries using **Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)** data.  
Unlike purely data-driven models, PINNs integrate **physical knowledge** (impedance‚ÄìSoC relationships) directly into the loss function, ensuring predictions are both **accurate and physically consistent**.

## üß† Key Concepts

- **Physics-Informed Learning:** Combines traditional regression objectives with **physics-based constraints**, e.g.,  
  - Negative correlation between impedance magnitude (|Z|) and SoC  
  - Smoothness of SoC predictions across adjacent points  

- **Custom Loss Function:**
- total_loss = MSE + 0.1 * correlation_penalty + 0.01 * smoothness_penalty

- **MSE:** Ensures data fidelity  
- **Correlation Penalty:** Enforces physical relationship between |Z| and SoC  
- **Smoothness Penalty:** Reduces unrealistic oscillations in predicted SoC  

- **Feature Engineering:**  
Input features include `[FREQUENCY_VALUE, ReZ, ImZ, |Z|]` derived from complex impedance measurements.

- **Benchmarking:** Classical ML regressors (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) are used for comparison to highlight the added value of physics-informed constraints.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
 - Merge impedance and frequency datasets  
 - Extract real (`ReZ`) and imaginary (`ImZ`) components  
 - Compute impedance magnitude `|Z|`

2. **Train-Test Split:**  
 - 80/20 train-test split to evaluate generalization  

3. **PINN Construction:**  
 - Sequential neural network: Dense layers `[128, 128, 64]` with `tanh` activation  
 - Physics-informed loss integrated via a custom Keras loss class  

4. **Model Training:**  
 - Optimizer: Adam, learning rate = 1e-3  
 - Epochs: 200, Batch size: 32  

5. **Evaluation Metrics:**  
 - Regression: `MSE`, `RMSE`, `R¬≤`  
 - Classification (high vs. low SoC): `Accuracy`, `F1 Score`  

6. **Comparison:**  
 - Classical ML models trained on the same features to assess performance improvement through physics integration
